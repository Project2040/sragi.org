## 🧠 AI-Generated Images

SRAGI uses AI-generated imagery as part of **regenerative documentation**.

### Principles
1. **Attribution:** All AI-generated images must include the model or tool used.  
   Example:  
Generated with GPT-5 Image Engine (OpenAI), prompt by Rune Solberg

2. **Ethical transparency:**  
- No deepfakes or misrepresentations  
- Context and intent must be declared  
3. **Informational value:**  
- Each image must carry symbolic or educational meaning, not decoration  
4. **Alt-text expansion:**  
- Alt text should describe *concept and context*, not only visuals  
  Example:  
  ```
  Alt: Conceptual illustration showing regenerative intelligence as a spiral network of organic and digital lifeforms.
  ```
